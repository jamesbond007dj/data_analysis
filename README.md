**Author**: James Bond (ilker Zaimoglu)
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
Data Analysis in jupyter lab and manipulating datasets.Visualising Seaborn and Mathlib Linear plot analysis


## Getting Started
Install Numpy, Pandas, mathlibplot, sklearn, jupyter, jupyter lab and created virtual enviorement and enter Jupyter Lab, read the necessary csv files. Seaborn and mathlib plots graphs.



## Architecture

2. Numpy
3. Data Manuplation
4. Mathlibplot
5. Sklearn
6. Linear Regression
7. Polynominal Regression 
8. Seaborn Chart Analysis
