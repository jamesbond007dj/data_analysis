# Data Analysis

**Author**: James Bond (ilker Zaimoglu)
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
Data Analysis in jupyter lab and manipulating datasets.Visualising Linear and Polynominal Regressions.


## Getting Started
Install Numpy, Pandas, mathlibplot, sklearn, jupyter, jupyter lab and created virtual enviorement and enter Jupyter Lab, read the necessary csv files.



## Architecture
Data Analysis is created with Python and Jupyter Lab using Linear and Polynominal regressions

## API
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Data Manuplation
4. Mathlibplot
5. Sklearn
6. Linear Regression
7. Polynominal Regression
